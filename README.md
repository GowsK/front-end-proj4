#DieFighter
##Angular & Canvas Space Shooter

Inspired by the recent release of the hotly anticipated Star Wars movie, DieFighter is an addictive arcade style mini-game seen as the love child between both Space Invaders and Asteroids. Sign up to compete against friends and top the all time scores in the leaderboard while quenching your thirst for all things Star Wars.

Don't forget to turn up the volume and play below!

##Instructions
Use the directional arrows to navigate your X-Wing through the onslaught of Tie Fighters and send them to their doom by firing lasers via the spacebar.
